# Relación entre análisis de riesgo y toma de decisiones: lectura

* Importante: identificar precisamente fuentes de riesgo e incertidumbre que
  afectan decisiones
* AD estudia riesgo e incertidumbre en decisiones, diagnosticando, tratando de
  mitigarlo, transferirlo o evadirlo
* DA uses data modeling, probability, statistics and Data Science to analyse
  risks and uncertainty.

## Notes on risk and uncertainty 

* Three main postures on risk and uncertainty:
    * there is no distinction
    * risk as a category of uncertainty
    * risk and uncertainty are different
* In this course:
    * **Uncertainty**: the outcome of a decision is undefined. Usually used in
      non-quantitative scenarios.
    * **Risk**: the outcome of a decision or event can be modelled by a
      probability distribution.
* Given a scenario of **uncertainty** the **risk** refers to the measure of the
  possible outcomes potentially produced by the situation and the way it affects
  the individual or organisation.

## Types of decisions

* **Deterministic**: results are known
* **Assuming risk**: the probability distribution of the outcome is known
* **Under uncertainty**: results and probability distribution are not known
