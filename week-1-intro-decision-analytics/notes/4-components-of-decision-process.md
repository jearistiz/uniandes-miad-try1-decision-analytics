# The decision process and its principal components

The components of a decision problem are:

1. the principal sources of **uncertainty**,
    this component is crucial. The decision is usually affected by variables
    that are risky by nature. Non-deterministic variables can be modelled,
    studied and analyzed. Probability, statistics and data science plays a major
    role in this point

2. the decision alternatives,
    * Possible solutions or next step to be evaluated by the decision maker
    * Alternatives or possible solutions which can be controlled by the decision
      maker.
3. the decision criteria,
4. the preferences of the decision maker,
    * utility theory studies the preferences of the decision maker
    * Bayesian theory studies subject probabilities that let us study the
      perceptions of an individual associated to the occurrence of a
      probabilistic event
5. the evaluation process of the decision alternatives,
    * Simple decisions do not require big analysis
    * Complex decisions require more complex tools:
        * Decision trees
        * Influence diagrams
        * Montecarlo simulations
    * Quantitative models are not enough, each decision is complex and somewhat
      "handcrafted" work.

* Before deciding the analysis tool:
    * Describe the problem
    * relevant variables
    * actors
    * alternatives

A good decision analysis consists of:

    * conceptual knowledge
    * creative alternatives
    * relevant and good information
    * decision criteria
    * good models
    * decision compromise
