# Types of decisions and problems

types of decisions:

    * **deterministic**
    * **under uncertainty**
    * **assuming risk**

types of problems:

    * **multi criteria**
    * **under risk/uncertainty**
    * **probabilistic inference**

* Decision analysis is focused on strategic decisions:
    * high impact
    * non-reversible
    * non-replicable
    * risky
    * long-term

* Usually strategic decisions in companies are not deterministic,

    * treating them as deterministic is an over-simplification of the scenario

* The quality of the decision is related to:
    * the quality of the available data and
    * the quality of the analysis of the data

* Important tools for analysis:
    * statistics
    * probability
    * data analytics

* To improve the decision making problem take into account:
    * good conceptual knowledge
    * creative and probable decision alternatives
    * relevant and fiable information
    * clarity on decision criteria
    * logical and appropriate data processing and modelling
    * commitment to the action / decision
