# Analytics and its Pillars

* High volumes of relevant information in modern times -> importance of
  processing and analyzing the data to make better decisions.
* **Analytics**: intensive use of data, statistics and quantitative analysis,
  predictive and descriptive models and data-driven decisions to improve the
  performance of a company.
* Data analytics techniques come from AI and statistics.
* Data analysis is becoming the cornerstone of most modern companies.
* Modern studies show that data-driven companies enjoy improvements in almost
  all their departments, not to mention the performance and utilities.

## The four pillars of Analytics

1. **Strategic differentiation**: analytics driven companies usually have a very
   well defined strategy fully supported by the data analysis paradigm.
2. **Analytics decisions are everywhere**: the data-driven framework must be
   applied within all the organisation and across different departments.
3. **Top management is committed to data analytics**: the main promoters of the
   analytics paradigm should be the members of the board of direction.
4. **Big scale ambition**: data driven companies must be ambitious and confident
   on the benefits of analytics.
