# Analytics Skill in Organizations

* **Analytics competency** can be represented in an index composed of five
  dimensions:

  1. quality of data,
  2. bigness of data,
  3. analytics abilities
  4. domain knowledge,
  5. tools sophistication

* All this dimensions improve significantly the quality of decisions
* Efficiency in decisions is also improved with all dimensions excluding the
  bigness of data.
* Only a small fraction of companies that invest in data analytics are really
  getting to know its benefits.
    * Companies must overcome several challenges to really take advantage of
      this paradigm
    * Most companies focus only in data but not in the process of thinking in
      solutions derived from the analysis of the data.
* The success of a company in implementing the data analytics framework is
  closely related to the quality of the five mentioned dimensions of
  _Analytics competency_

## The Analytics Maturity Curve

* Companies usually think of ways to measure their _Analytics Maturity_
* Some quantitative models have been developed which help in identifying
  strengths and weaknesses:
    * Business Intelligence Maturity Models (BIMM)
    * Analytic Maturity Models (AMM)
* A relevant qualitative, simple model to evaluate the Analytics Maturity in
  organizations is the **Analytics Maturity Curve** which is based on five
  progressive categories (in terms of complexity) of data analysis:

  1. descriptive analytics
  2. diagnostic analytics
  3. predictive analytics
  4. prescriptive analytics
  5. cognitive analytics
